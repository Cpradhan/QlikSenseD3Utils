QlikSenseD3Utils
================
This is a library intended to help Qlik Sense Extension developers in the creation of D3 visualizations.  Right now, there are only a few functions, mostly related to the creation of visualizations based on Tree Data. That being said...

**PLEASE CONTRIBUTE**

The idea here is that as we work on D3 visualizations in Sense we could add them to this library.  D3 has several different ways of dealing with data, but as you cover one of these ways, it opens up the possibilities for many visualizations built on this data schema.
For example, the createFamily function in this library takes Qlik Sense data and formats it in a way similar to the flare.json data set that you see used in many D3 visualizations.  If a developer is wanting to build a viz which uses flare, it should be fairly easy to get up and running by using this createFamily function.

*********************************
Installation & Use
*********************************
To get access to the function in this library, simply include the senseD3utils library in your require script in your new extension.  Please see the [Zoomable Sunburst extension](https://github.com/brianwmunz/QlikSenseD3ZoomableSunbust) if you're unsure.  
For example:
```
define(["jquery", "text!./style.css", "./d3.v3.min", "**./senseD3utils**"], function($, cssContent) {

```
Once it's included, you can call the D3 functions by first using the library namespace, **senseD3**, and calling the function.  So for example, to use the computeTextRotation function, you call it this way:
```
senseD3.computeTextRotation(e, x);
```
and createFamily would be called this way, with the qMatrix data being passed in:
```
senseD3.createFamily(qData.qMatrix);
```


*********************************
      Function Overview       
*********************************
**createFamily**

This function accepts the qMatrix of data from Qlik Sense and returns a JSON object structured in a Tree parent/child format. 
To learn more about the Tree Layout data format, read here:

[https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tree-Layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Tree-Layout)

The layout that's created by createFamily is based on the commonly used data set in D3 examples called flare.json, which you can see here:  

[http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4063550/flare.json](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4063550/flare.json)

In order for this to work properly, the data for the extension needs to be formatted in a child/parent/value format.  This way, the function knows all of the associations between the data and can create a tree from it.  Again, please see the [Sunburst extension example](https://github.com/brianwmunz/QlikSenseD3ZoomableSunbust).

In your extension script, you need to first create a JSON object to hold the data tree:
```
var myJSON = {"name":layout.title,"children":[]};
```
If you looked at the flare.json example, you'll notice that this simply creates the very top level of the tree.  In this case it sets that top level to the title of the extension object.
Once this is done, you simply run the function against the qMatrix data and load it in as children to the top category:
```
myJSON.children = senseD3.createFamily(qMatrix);
```
Now you have well formatted data that can be loaded into a d3 viz.  For example, the sunburst chart was easy to get running once the data was converted since most of the code that builds the viz itself doesn't need to be modified.

**computeTextRotation**
this is a function used in many d3 visualizations to compute the proper rotation of the text on the viz.  The required parameters for the function should be similar to what is used in the vizualization normally.  The first parameter is the d3 object itself and the second is a variable that is typically represented as "x" in most d3 viz.  It's essentially a range and scale of the viz:
```
senseD3.computeTextRotation(e,x);
```

**arcTween**
this is another commonly seen function for animation that computes the arcs.  d is once again the parameter for the object itself.  It would be easiest to learn about the other parameters by looking at the sunburst extension.
```
senseD3.arcTween(d, x, y, radius, arc)
```
